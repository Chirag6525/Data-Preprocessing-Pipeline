# Data-Preprocessing-Pipeline
A data preprocessing pipeline is a systematic and automated approach that combines multiple preprocessing steps into a cohesive workflow. It serves as a roadmap for data professionals, guiding them through the transformations and calculations needed to cleanse and prepare data for analysis. 

## Preprocessing Tasks
    1.imputing missing values
    2.scaling numeric features
    3.finding and removing outliers
    4.encoding categorical variables

## Preprocessing & Professionals
A Data Preprocessing pipeline is crucial to help various data science professionals, including data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers, in their respective roles.

For Data Engineers, the pipeline simplifies work by automating data transformation tasks, allowing them to focus on designing scalable data architectures and optimizing data pipelines.

Data Analysts benefit from the pipelineâ€™s ability to normalize and clean data, ensuring accuracy and reducing time spent on data cleaning tasks. It allows analysts to spend more time on exploratory data analysis and gaining meaningful insights.

On the other hand, Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers rely on clean and well-preprocessed data for accurate predictive modelling and advanced analytics. The preprocessing pipeline automates repetitive preprocessing tasks, allowing them efficiently experiment and quickly iterate on their datasets.
